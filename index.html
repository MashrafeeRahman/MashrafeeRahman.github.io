        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Mashrafee Rahman and I am currently a senior in Thomas A. Edison CTE High-School. <br>
            I am 17 years old and will be attending college this year in August. <br>
            I have chosen to major in computer science and right now I am taking classes to learn about the coding language HTML. <br>
            I have already gotten accustomed to the coding language HTML and I have completed many projects that I am proud of.</p>
